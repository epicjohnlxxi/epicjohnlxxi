# Hello!
My name is John, and I am a Gaming YouTuber, Game Developer, and Programmer. This README contains different info on my work, personal info about me, etc.

# Info about me
Like I said, my name is John. I am a 15 year old high school student who has a passion for Content Creation and Programming. 

I personally love horror movies, and most Stanley Kubrick movies, like The Shining. I also love classic and nostalgic movies, like both the 1971 and 2005 film adaptations of Willy Wonka/Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

My Favorite Shows are also old-timey shows, like Adam-12 and The Andy Griffith Show, but I also love newer-ish shows like King of the Hill, Stranger Things, The Simpsons, and House M.D.

Last but not least, my favorite games are Boneworks/Bonelab, DOOM, GTA, Garry's Mod, Half-Life 2, Portal, and POSTAL 2.

# My Work

## YouTube
I make YouTube videos of me playing various VR (occasionally PC) games, and sometimes even with friends. As of 02/25/2024, I have 30.9k subscribers. I previously made Gorilla Tag VR videos, but have since moved on from it, making videos on other games such as Rec Room VR, Bonelab/Boneworks, Phasmophobia, etc.

## Game Development
I also like to make games either solo or with friends. I have a game team that consists of me, and some of my closest friends. The Team is named "False Dynamite Interactive", which derives from a running gag between me and the team. Our games mostly consist of PC Adventure and Horror Games. We have released one game so far, which has since been pulled from itch.io.

## Coding
I have been coding since the early age of 12. I'm not completely *fluent* in different coding languages, but I personally like using languages like the different ones in the C family (C, C++, C#), Python, and Java. I also like the web development languages (HTML, CSS, JS (JS to an extent)).
